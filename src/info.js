	Bio: `My name is Caius Arias and I'm interested in looking for positions that utilize programming or information security. I have recently received my Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification from ISC2.

I worked as a Technology Support Specialist for Gurnee School District 56 where I mainly serviced Prairie Trail School but also covered other schools within the district.  I solved a large variety of problems covering Macbooks, iPads, printers and copiers, projectors, sound systems, security cameras, new staff and student setup, etc. so that student education remained undisrupted.

I doubled majored in Computer Science and Asian Studies with a focus in Japan. My coding language of choice is Python, followed Javascript. While in college, my senior project in computer science was to work in a small team to create a VR orchestra conductor simulator to help the student conductors in the Music department.

I speak Spanish at the native level and Japanese at advanced intermediate.

In my free time I practice my coding and Japanese skills, experiment in video editing, play video games, and take too many pictures of my cat.`,
