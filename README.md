# personal-website
I created this introductory personal website to introduce myself. The website uses create-react-app as the base and thus uses Javascript, React, and Node.

### How to run
Since the website is not hosted online, you will need to use Node to build the package dependencies as listed in the packages JSON. Then, run `npm start` in the folder src is located to start the localhost to view my simple website.
